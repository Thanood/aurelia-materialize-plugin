# aurelia-materialize-plugin

This is the new instance of the original repository at https://github.com/manuel-guilbault/aurelia-materialize. It is built in a different way than the original, matching the standard practice of Aurelia core development team members, where both the plugin and the sample that consumes the plugin services "live" in the same project. 

See [this wiki article](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-materialize-plugin/wiki/How-to-build-and-use-aurelia-materialize-plugin) to find more about this project's internal structure.

As the above screen shot suggests, the plugin exports a single control from the [materialize](http://materializecss.com/) framework - Collapsible. The collection of supported controls will grow as the aurelia-materialize team gets up to speed with this project
